# GSEmulator
One of two modules to fix the limit of 64 players of Battlefield's gamespy query.

GSEmulator mantains a local version of the server's information allowing it to resopond to GameSpy queries without the 64 player's limitation.

The information, in GSEmulator, is updated by receiving constant updates from the server's python module.

GSEmulator is meant to be used with [GSDiverter](https://github.com/UTurista/GSDiverter), to allow a clean integration.
